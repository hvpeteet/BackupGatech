# 3210-final-project
Paging to disk final project for CS 3210 spring 2016

To run a user program please go into the code directory and "make run-<programname>". For our project in particular the test user file is called memoryoverload, so you can make run-memoryoverload. This will spin up a file that uses all of physcial memory (and then some). 

Most of the implementation of this project is contained inside of kern/paging_utils.h and kern/paging_utils.c.
